	 	     <p></p>Hi! My name is Martin T. Cabajar Jr. and I was born on July 12, 2002 in Brgy. Bonbon Barangay Hall. 
	       My parents names are Florenda Cabajar and Martin Cabajar Sr., I have 3 siblings,we are 4 in total, two boys and two girls.
      
	      <p></p> There are a lot of things I like and I dont.
	       I like to be alone sometimes, I love listening to kpop songs especially songs from Blackpink, aespa, Twice, and Itzy. Because their music gives me happiness, peace ang chill. 
	       I like scouting, actually Im a scout since elementary until senior high school in our school Bonbon National High School.
	       I also like to play mobile games but now I'm tired of playing, I only play games if I want.The things I dont like are being in crouded places, I dont know why I dont like to be with other people especially those people who I dont know who they are.
	       <p></p>And thats all!
	       <p></p>Thank You!
